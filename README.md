This game is played by moving the mouse to aim the cannon and then press the S, D, and F key to fire bullets worth 1, 2, and 3 respectively. There are three levels where the time in between the boxes spawning is decreased and the max number on the box is increased. Once the player reaches level 3, the game is endless until the time runs out. If the players score ever reaches 0 or the timer runs out, the game is over.
